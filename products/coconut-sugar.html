            Coconut sugar, also known as <u>coconut palm sugar or coco sugar</u>, is a natural sweetener derived from
            the sap of coconut palm trees<br><br>

            It is a popular <u>alternative</u> to traditional cane sugar and is commonly used as a healthier and more
            sustainable sweetener option <br><br>

            It has a caramel-like flavor with a hint of coconut, which can add a <u>unique taste</u> to recipes

            Coconut sugar can be used as a <u>substitute for cane sugar</u> in a variety of recipes, including
            beverages, baked goods, desserts, and savory dishes <br><br>

            It is often used as a one-to-one replacement for cane sugar due to its unique flavor profile <br><br>

            Coconut sugar is often considered <u>more sustainable</u> compared to cane sugar because it is derived from
            a renewable resourceâ€”the coconut palm tree <br><br>

            Coconut sugar is made by collecting the sap from the flower buds of coconut palm trees <br><br>

            Farmers make incisions in the bud stalks and collect the sap that drips out. The sap is then heated to
            evaporate the moisture, leaving behind granules or blocks of coconut sugar <br><br>

            Coconut sugar has gained popularity among those seeking <u>low-glycemic sweeteners</u> <br><br>
          </p>
