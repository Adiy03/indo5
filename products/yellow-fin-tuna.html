        <h2 id="target1" class="content">Yellowfin Tuna</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Yellowfin tuna, also known as Thunnus albacares, is popular species of tuna found in the tropical and
            subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. It is named after its bright yellow fins
            <br><br>

            Yellowfin tuna is slightly smaller in size compared to bluefin tuna, typically reaching lengths of about 6
            to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 meters) and weighing up to 400 pounds (180 kilograms) <br><br>

            They have a sleek, streamlined body with metallic dark blue or black color on their back and
            yellowish-silver on their sides and belly <br><br>

            Yellowfin tuna is highly regarded for its firm, flavorful flesh, making it a popular choice in cuisines
            worldwide. It is often used in a variety of dishes, including sushi, sashimi, seared tuna steaks, and
            grilled preparations <br><br>

            The flesh of yellowfin tuna has a slightly milder flavor compared to bluefin tuna but is still prized for
            its quality
          </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <h2 id="target2" class="content">Yellowfin vs Bluefin</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are two different species of tuna, each
          with its own characteristics and qualities. Here are some advantages of yellowfin tuna compared to bluefin
          tuna: <br><br>

          <b>1. Availability:</b> Yellowfin tuna tends to be more abundant and widely available compared to bluefin
          tuna. Yellowfin tuna can be found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, including the Pacific,
          Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Bluefin tuna, on the other hand, is known faced overfishing concerns in certain
          regions <br><br>

          <b>2. Price:</b> Yellowfin tuna is generally more affordable compared to bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna is highly
          sought after, especially the prized and scarce varieties such as the bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean,
          which can fetch very high prices in the market <br><br>

          <b>3. Flavor and Texture:</b> Yellowfin tuna has a slightly milder flavor compared to bluefin tuna, which is
          known for its rich, buttery taste. Yellowfin tuna has a firm texture and is often preferred for cooking
          methods that require a firmer fish, such as grilling or searing <br><br>

          <b>4. Sustainability:</b> Yellowfin tuna is considered to have a more sustainable population compared to
          certain bluefin tuna stocks, which have been heavily overfished

        <h2 id="target3" class="content">Skipjack Tuna</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">

          Skipjack tuna, also known as Katsuwonus pelamis, is another species of tuna that is commonly found in tropical
          and subtropical waters around the world. In Indonesian cuisine, skipjack tuna is often referred to as
          "cakalang" or "ikan cakalang." <br><br>

          Skipjack tuna is smaller in size compared to bluefin and yellowfin tuna, typically reaching lengths of about 2
          to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) and weighing around 10 to 30 pounds (4.5 to 13.5 kilograms) <br><br>

          They have a streamlined body with metallic dark blue or black color on their back and a silvery-white belly
          <br><br>

          Cakalang (skipjack tuna) is widely used in Indonesian cuisine, particularly in regions like North Sulawesi,
          where it is considered a staple ingredient. It is often used in traditional dishes such as "Cakalang Fufu,"
          which is a slow-cooked skipjack tuna with various spices, and "Nasi Kuning Manado," which is yellow rice
          served with shredded cakalang <br><br>

          Skipjack tuna has a firm and meaty texture with a slightly stronger flavor compared to other tuna species. It
          is commonly used for grilling, smoking, and in stews, curries, and stir-fry dishes. Due to its robust flavor,
          skipjack tuna is also popularly used in canned tuna production

        <h2 id="target4" class="content">Tuna Saku</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">

          Tuna saku, also known as <strong>tuna loin or tuna block</strong>, refers to a specific cut of tuna meat
          commonly used in the culinary industry. It is a rectangular or cylindrical piece of tuna that is typically
          obtained from larger tuna species like yellowfin or bluefin tuna <br><br>

          Here are some key details about tuna saku: <br><br>

          Tuna saku is derived from the loin section of the tuna, which is known for its firm texture and rich flavor.
          The loins are carefully trimmed and cut into consistent rectangular or cylindrical shapes, making them ideal
          for various culinary applications <br><br>

          <b>Size and Shape:</b> Tuna saku comes in different sizes, but they are generally uniform and compact. The
          dimensions can vary, but they typically have a length of about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters), a width
          of 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters), and a thickness of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters). The specific
          size can be customized based on culinary requirements <br><br>

          <b>Quality and Freshness:</b> Tuna saku is highly regarded for its premium quality. It is typically sourced
          from top-grade tuna species and selected for its freshness and desirable attributes. The meat should have a
          vibrant color, firm texture, and minimal bruising or discoloration <br><br>

          <b>Culinary Uses:</b> Tuna saku is a versatile ingredient in the kitchen and is widely used in both raw and
          cooked preparations. It is commonly used in sushi, sashimi, and poke bowls due to its ability to hold its
          shape and be easily sliced into thin, uniform pieces <br><br>

          Tuna saku is also suitable for grilling, searing, or pan-frying, where it can be cooked to various degrees of
          doneness while retaining its moistness and flavor <br><br>

          <b>Availability:</b> Tuna saku is available from reputable seafood suppliers and is commonly found in high-end
          seafood markets, sushi restaurants, and professional kitchens. It is often purchased in bulk quantities to
          ensure consistent supply and maintain quality <br><br>

          Yellowfin Minced Tuna / Negitoro
        </h2> <br>

        <div class="content">

          Yellowfin tuna negitoro, also known as minced tuna, is a popular dish in Japanese cuisine. It typically
          consists of finely minced or chopped yellowfin tuna mixed with finely chopped scallions (green onions)
          <br><br>

          The name "negitoro" is derived from two Japanese words: "negi," which means scallions, and "toro," which
          refers to the fatty part of the tuna <br><br>

          To prepare yellowfin tuna negitoro, the yellowfin tuna is usually filleted and then minced using a sharp knife
          or a food processor. The minced tuna is then mixed with finely chopped scallions, which add a fresh and
          onion-like flavor to the dish. The ratio of tuna to scallions can vary depending on personal preference
          <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna is known for its rich flavor and firm texture, making it an excellent choice for negitoro. It
          is important to use fresh and high-quality tuna when making this dish to ensure the best taste and texture
          <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna negitoro is commonly used as a topping or filling in various Japanese dishes. It is a popular
          ingredient in sushi rolls, where it is often wrapped in seaweed (nori) along with rice and other ingredients
          <br><br>

          It can also be served on top of rice bowls (donburi), mixed with soy sauce and served as a dip for tempura or
          sashimi, or used as a filling for hand rolls (temaki) <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna negitoro is a delicious and versatile dish that showcases the flavors of fresh tuna and
          scallions, offering a delightful combination of tastes and textures commonly enjoyed in Japanese cuisine
