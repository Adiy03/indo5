            It is named after its bright yellow fins <br><br>
            
            <!-- <br><br> -->
            Yellowfin tuna is highly regarded for its firm, flavorful flesh, making it a popular choice in cuisines
            worldwide. It is often used in a variety of dishes, including sushi, sashimi, seared tuna steaks, and
            grilled preparations <br><br>

            The flesh of yellowfin tuna has a slightly milder flavor compared to bluefin tuna but is still prized for its quality <br><br>

            No like bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna is slightly smaller in size compared to bluefin tuna, typically reaching lengths of about 6
            to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 meters) and weighing up to 400 pounds (180 kilograms) <br><br>

        <h2 id="target2" class="content">Yellowfin vs Bluefin</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          <p>
          Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are two different species of tuna, each
          with its own characteristics and qualities <br><br>
          
          Here are some advantages of yellowfin tuna compared to bluefin
          tuna: <br><br>

          <b>1. Availability:</b> <br><br> 
          
          Yellowfin tuna tends to be more abundant and widely available compared to bluefin tuna <br><br>
          
          Yellowfin tuna can be found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, including the Pacific,
          Atlantic, and Indian Oceans <br><br>
          
          Bluefin tuna, on the other hand, is known faced overfishing concerns in certain
          regions <br><br>

          <b>2. Price:</b> <br><br> 
          
          Yellowfin tuna is generally more affordable compared to bluefin tuna <br><br>
          
          Bluefin tuna is highly
          sought after, especially the prized and scarce varieties such as the bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean,
          which can fetch very high prices in the market <br><br>

          <b>3. Flavor and Texture:</b> <br><br> 
          
          Yellowfin tuna has a slightly milder flavor compared to bluefin tuna, which is
          known for its rich, buttery taste <br><br>
          
          Yellowfin tuna has a firm texture and is often preferred for cooking
          methods that require a firmer fish, such as grilling or searing <br><br>

          <b>4. Sustainability:</b> <br><br> 
          
          Yellowfin tuna is considered to have a more sustainable population compared to
          certain bluefin tuna stocks, which have been heavily overfished

        <div class="content">
          
          <p>

          Skipjack tuna, also known as Katsuwonus pelamis, is another species of tuna that is commonly found in tropical
          and subtropical waters around the world <br><br>
          
          In Indonesian cuisine, skipjack tuna is often referred to as
          "cakalang" or "ikan cakalang." <br><br>

          <img src="../assets/img-product/cakalang.jpg" alt="Buy Skipjack / Cakalang in Bulk from Indo5export.com" class="content"> <br>

          Skipjack tuna is smaller in size compared to bluefin and yellowfin tuna, typically reaching lengths of about 2
          to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) and weighing around 10 to 30 pounds (4.5 to 13.5 kilograms) <br><br>

          They have a streamlined body with metallic dark blue or black color on their back and a silvery-white belly
          <br><br>

          Skipjack tuna has a firm and meaty texture with a slightly stronger flavor compared to other tuna species <br><br>
          
          It is commonly used for grilling, smoking, and in stews, curries, and stir-fry dishes. Due to its robust flavor,
          skipjack tuna is also popularly used in canned tuna production <br><br>

          Cakalang (skipjack tuna) is widely used in Indonesian cuisine, particularly in regions like North Sulawesi,
          where it is considered a staple ingredient <br><br>
          
          It is often used in traditional dishes such as "Cakalang Fufu,"
          which is a slow-cooked skipjack tuna with various spices, and "Nasi Kuning Manado," which is yellow rice
          served with shredded cakalang <br><br>

        </p>
        <p>

          Here are some key details about tuna saku: <br><br>

          Tuna saku is derived from the loin section of the tuna, which is known for its firm texture and rich flavor <br><br>

          The loins are carefully trimmed and cut into consistent rectangular or cylindrical shapes, making them ideal
          for various culinary applications <br><br>

          <b>Size and Shape:</b> Tuna saku comes in different sizes, but they are generally uniform and compact. The
          dimensions can vary, but they typically have a length of about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters), a width
          of 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters), and a thickness of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters). The specific
          size can be customized based on culinary requirements <br><br>

          <b>Quality and Freshness:</b> Tuna saku is highly regarded for its premium quality. It is typically sourced
          from top-grade tuna species and selected for its freshness and desirable attributes. The meat should have a
          vibrant color, firm texture, and minimal bruising or discoloration <br><br>

          <b>Culinary Uses:</b> Tuna saku is a versatile ingredient in the kitchen and is widely used in both raw and
          cooked preparations <br><br>
          
          It is commonly used in sushi, sashimi, and poke bowls due to its ability to hold its
          shape and be easily sliced into thin, uniform pieces <br><br>

          Tuna saku is also suitable for grilling, searing, or pan-frying, where it can be cooked to various degrees of
          doneness while retaining its moistness and flavor <br><br>

          <b>Availability:</b> Tuna saku is available from reputable seafood suppliers and is commonly found in high-end
          seafood markets, sushi restaurants, and professional kitchens. It is often purchased in bulk quantities to
          ensure consistent supply and maintain quality <br><br>

          Yellowfin Minced Tuna / Negitoro
        </h2> <br>

        <div class="content">

          <p>
          Yellowfin tuna negitoro, also known as minced tuna, is a popular dish in Japanese cuisine <br><br>
          
          It typically
          consists of finely minced or chopped yellowfin tuna mixed with finely chopped scallions (green onions)
          <br><br>

          The name "negitoro" is derived from two Japanese words: "negi," which means scallions, and "toro," which
          refers to the fatty part of the tuna <br><br>

          To prepare yellowfin tuna negitoro, the yellowfin tuna is usually filleted and then minced using a sharp knife
          or a food processor <br><br>
          
          The minced tuna is then mixed with finely chopped scallions, which add a fresh and
          onion-like flavor to the dish <br><br>
          
          The ratio of tuna to scallions can vary depending on personal preference
          <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna is known for its rich flavor and firm texture, making it an excellent choice for negitoro <br><br>
          
          It
          is important to use fresh and high-quality tuna when making this dish to ensure the best taste and texture
          <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna negitoro is commonly used as a topping or filling in various Japanese dishes <br><br>
          
          It is a popular
          ingredient in sushi rolls, where it is often wrapped in seaweed (nori) along with rice and other ingredients
          <br><br>

          It can also be served on top of rice bowls (donburi), mixed with soy sauce and served as a dip for tempura or
          sashimi, or used as a filling for hand rolls (temaki) <br><br>

          Yellowfin tuna negitoro is a delicious and versatile dish that showcases the flavors of fresh tuna and
          scallions, offering a delightful combination of tastes and textures commonly enjoyed in Japanese cuisine
