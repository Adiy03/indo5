        <h2 id="target1" class="content">Tapioca</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          Tapioca is a starchy substance extracted from the cassava plant's tuberous roots. It is a versatile ingredient
          that is widely used in culinary preparations around the world. Tapioca is popular for its unique texture and
          is commonly used as a thickening agent in both sweet and savory dishes <br><br>

          It can be found in various forms, such as tapioca balls also known as boba or pearls, flakes, or flour, and is
          a staple in desserts like puddings, bubble tea, and tapioca-based snacks <br><br>

        </div>

        <br>

        <h2 id="target2" class="content">Tapioca other names</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          In general, tapioca flour, tapioca starch, tapioca powder, and cassava powder are different names used to
          describe the same productâ€”the refined and powdered form of the starch extracted from the cassava root <br><br>

          However, it's worth noting that in some cases, manufacturers or regions may use different terms, but the
          underlying ingredient and its characteristics remain the same. <br><br>

        <h2 id="target3" class="content">Organic tapioca starch</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          <h3>The main difference between organic tapioca starch and tapioca lies in their production methods and
            characteristics:</h3><br>

          <b>Production:</b> <br><br>
          It is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
          <br><br>

          On the other hand, tapioca is a more general term that refers to the starchy substance extracted from the
          cassava plant's tuberous roots, regardless of the farming methods employed <br><br>

          <b>Organic Certification:</b> <br><br>
          Organic tapioca starch has obtained organic certification, indicating that it meets specific standards set by
          certifying bodies for organic agriculture <br><br>

          This certification ensures that the product has been produced in compliance with organic farming practices and
          has not been treated with chemical pesticides or fertilizers <br><br>

          Tapioca, on the other hand, does not necessarily carry organic certification unless specifically labeled as
          such <br><br>

          <b>Usage:</b> <br><br>

          Organic tapioca starch is primarily used as a thickening agent and stabilizer in various food and beverage
          applications. It is valued for its ability to create a smooth and glossy texture when cooked <br><br>

          Tapioca, in its broader sense, can refer to various forms of tapioca, including tapioca pearls, flakes, or
          flour. These different forms of tapioca are used for different culinary purposes, such as bubble tea toppings,
          desserts, or gluten-free baking <br><br>

          <b>Quality and Purity:</b> <br><br>

          Organic tapioca starch tends to be regarded as a higher-quality product due to the organic farming practices
          employed in its production. It is generally considered to be free from synthetic additives and contaminants
          <br><br>

          Tapioca, on the other hand, can vary in quality and purity depending on the specific brand or source <br><br>

          While both organic tapioca starch and tapioca are derived from the cassava plant, the term "organic tapioca
          starch" specifically refers to tapioca starch produced using organic farming methods and certified as organic
          <br><br>

          Tapioca, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses various forms of the cassava plant's starchy
          substance and may not necessarily carry organic certification or meet organic standards <br><br>

        </div>

        <h2 id="target4" class="content">Indonesia Tapioca</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">
          The production and consumption of tapioca in Indonesia are widespread, as cassava plants grow easily in
          various regions of the country. Cassava is an important food crop in Indonesia, and its processed products
          like tapioca contribute to the food industry and the local economy. <br><br>

          Tapioca in Indonesia is generally available in various brands and packaging in traditional markets, food
          ingredient stores, and supermarkets. This allows consumers to choose between different brands and qualities of
          tapioca according to their needs.
          <br><br>

          Tapioca from Indonesia has several advantages that make it a popular choice both domestically and in the
          international market. Here are some of the advantages of Indonesian tapioca:
          <br><br>

          <b>Abundance of Raw Materials:</b> <br>
          Indonesia is one of the largest producers of cassava in the world, and cassava is the main raw material for
          tapioca production. The abundant availability of cassava ensures a stable and sustainable supply for tapioca
          production in Indonesia <br><br>

          <b>Competitive Pricing:</b> <br>
          As Indonesia is one of the major tapioca producers globally, the price of Indonesian tapioca tends to be
          competitive compared to other countries. This makes it an economical choice for both large and small-scale
          food and beverage manufacturers <br><br>

          <b>Product Quality:</b> <br>
          Indonesian tapioca is known for its good quality. Careful production processes and strict quality standards
          ensure that Indonesian tapioca meets cleanliness, purity, and consistency requirements. This makes it suitable
          for various applications in the food and beverage industry.

        <h2 id="target5" class="content">Tapioca grades</h2> <br>

        <div class="content">

          Tapioca Grades are often used to differentiate tapioca products based on factors such as purity, texture,
          size, color, and other quality attributes <br><br>

          <b>Grade 1</b>: <br>
          Tapioca Grade 1 has a minimum purity level (leucorrhoea) of 95.5% and a thickness ranging from 3 to 4. Grade
          1 tapioca exhibits very high quality in terms of purity and thickness, making it a desired choice for
          applications that require consistent and high-quality end results. <br><br>

          <b>Grade 2</b> <br>
          Tapioca Grade 2 has a minimum whiteness level of 92 and viscosity ranging from 2.5 to 3. Grade 2 tapioca
          offers good brightness and stable viscosity, suitable for use in various food and beverage applications.
          Grade 2 provides good quality at a more affordable price <br><br>

          <b>Grade 3</b> <br>
          Tapioca Grade 3 has a whiteness level less than 92 and viscosity less than 2.5. Grade 3 tapioca tends to
          have lower whiteness and a softer viscosity. Grade 3 can be a suitable choice for use where whiteness and
          viscosity are not critical factors or in products with lighter processing requirements <br><br>

          <b>Grade 4</b> <br>
          Tapioca Grade 4 has a whiteness level less than 90 and viscosity less than 2. Grade 4 tapioca has low
          whiteness and very soft viscosity. Grade 4 may be more suitable for use where whiteness is not a critical
          factor, and low viscosity is desired<br><br>
