      <h2>Dried Cassava</h2> <br>

      Dried cassava, also known as dried yuca or dried manioc, is cassava that has been processed to remove moisture and extend its shelf life. Drying cassava is a common preservation method used in many cassava-producing regions to prevent spoilage and ensure a longer storage life <br><br>

      The process of drying cassava involves peeling and slicing the cassava roots, and then drying them using various methods such as sun drying, oven drying, or mechanical drying. Once the cassava slices are fully dried, they become hard and brittle, with a lower moisture content compared to fresh cassava <br><br>

      Dried cassava can be used as a source of food, particularly in areas where fresh cassava may not be readily available. It can be rehydrated by soaking in water or other liquids, and then cooked or used in various culinary preparations. Dried cassava can be ground into flour to make porridge, pancakes, or other baked goods <br><br>

      Dried cassava is lightweight and has a long shelf life, making it convenient for storage and transportation. It can be a useful food source in situations where fresh cassava is not accessible or for emergency food aid <br><br>

      <h2>Cassava Chips</h2> <br>

      Cassava chips are a popular snack food made from sliced and fried cassava roots. They are a tasty and crunchy alternative to potato chips and are a popular snack in many parts of the world <br><br>

      To make cassava chips, the cassava roots are first peeled and sliced into thin rounds or strips. The slices are then soaked in water to remove excess starch and dried in the sun or a dehydrator. The dried slices are then fried in oil until they are crispy and golden brown <br><br>

      Cassava chips have several advantages over potato chips: <br><br>

      Health benefits: Cassava chips are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, <br>
      and minerals such as potassium and manganese <br><br>

      Gluten-free: Cassava chips are gluten-free, making them a good alternative <br>
      for people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease <br><br>

      Low fat: Cassava chips are lower in fat than potato chips <br>
      and contain no cholesterol <br><br>

      Versatility: Cassava chips can be flavored in a variety of ways, <br>
      such as with salt, pepper, garlic, or chili powder <br><br>

      <h2>Cassava Flour</h2> <br>

      Cassava flour is a gluten-free, grain-free flour made from the root of the cassava plant. It is a popular ingredient in many gluten-free and paleo recipes and is commonly used as a <strong> substitute for wheat flour </strong> <br><br>

      To make cassava flour, the cassava root is peeled, grated, and dried. The dried cassava is then ground into a fine powder. Cassava flour is different from tapioca flour, which is made from the starchy liquid extracted from the cassava root <br><br>

      Cassava flour has several advantages over wheat flour: <br><br>

      Gluten-free: Cassava flour is naturally gluten-free, making it a great alternative for people with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease <br><br>

      Nutrient-dense: Cassava flour is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, including vitamin C, calcium, and potassium <br><br>

      Versatile: Cassava flour can be used in a variety of recipes, including bread, pancakes, cookies, and cakes. It has a neutral flavor, which makes it a good substitute for wheat flour in many recipes
      <br><br>

      Grain-free: Cassava flour is grain-free, which makes it a good option for people following a paleo or grain-free diet <br><br>

      <h2>Cassava Fries</h2> <br>

      Cassava fries are a tasty and healthy alternative to traditional potato fries. They are made from sliced and fried cassava roots and are popular in many parts of the world <br><br>

      To make cassava fries, the cassava roots are peeled and sliced into thin fries. The fries are then soaked in water to remove excess starch and dried. The dried fries are then fried in oil until they are crispy and golden brown <br><br>

      <h2>Is cassava same as yuca?</h2> <br>

      Yes, cassava and yuca are the same plant. Cassava is also known as yuca, yucca, manioc, or Brazilian arrowroot. It is a starchy tuberous root that is widely consumed in many parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and South America <br><br>
      
      The terms "cassava" and "yuca" are often used interchangeably, although "cassava" is more commonly used in Africa and Asia, while "yuca" is more commonly used in South America and the Caribbean <br><br>

      <h2>Are cassava and taro the same?</h2> <br>

      Cassava and taro are not the same, although they are both <br> 
      root vegetables and can be used in similar ways in cooking <br><br>

      Cassava, also known as yuca, is a starchy tuberous root that is native to South America. It is an important crop in many parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and South America. Cassava is often used to make flour, chips, and fries, and can also be boiled, mashed, or roasted <br><br>

      Taro, also known as dasheen, is a root vegetable that is native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a staple food in many parts of Asia and the Pacific, and is often used to make poi, a traditional Hawaiian dish made from mashed taro. Taro can also be boiled, fried, or roasted <br><br>

      While cassava and taro are both root vegetables, they have distinct differences in appearance, taste, and texture. Cassava has a brown, rough exterior and a white or yellow interior, while taro has a brown, hairy exterior and a white, purple, or pink interior. Cassava has a nutty, slightly sweet flavor and a starchy texture, while taro has a mild, nutty flavor and a starchy, slightly slimy texture when cooked <br><br>

      <h2>Cassava Starch</h2> <br>

      Cassava starch is a type of starch extracted from the cassava root, <br>
      which is also known as yuca, manioc, or tapioca <br><br>

      The process of extracting cassava starch involves washing and peeling the cassava roots, then grating or grinding them into a pulp. The pulp is then mixed with water and sieved to separate the starch from the fibrous residue. The starch is then dried and may be further processed into various forms, such as flour, pearls, or flakes <br><br>

      Cassava starch is widely used in food and industrial applications. In food, it is used as a thickener, binder, and stabilizer in products such as soups, sauces, gravies, and baked goods <br><br>
      
      It is also used to make noodles, vermicelli, and other types of pasta. In industrial applications, cassava starch is used as a raw material for the production of adhesives, paper, textiles, and other products <br><br>

      Cassava starch is gluten-free, making it a popular alternative to wheat-based flours for people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. It is also high in carbohydrates and low in protein and fat, which makes it a good source of energy for athletes or people with high energy needs <br><br>

      <h2>Cassava Bag</h2> <br>

      A cassava bag is a bag made from cassava starch, which is a biodegradable and renewable material. Cassava bags are a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic bags, which are made from non-renewable resources and can take hundreds of years to decompose <br><br>

      Cassava bags are made by processing cassava starch into a flexible and durable material that can be molded into different shapes and sizes. The material is then used to make bags, which can be used for a variety of purposes, including shopping, carrying groceries, and packaging <br><br>

      Cassava bags have several advantages over traditional plastic bags: <br><br>

      Environmentally friendly: Cassava bags are biodegradable and compostable, <br>
      which means they can be broken down by natural processes and do not contribute <br>
      to environmental pollution <br><br>

      Renewable: Cassava is a renewable resource that can be grown and harvested <br>
      year after year, making cassava bags a sustainable alternative to plastic bags <br><br>

      Strong and durable: Cassava bags are strong and durable, <br>
      and can hold a significant amount of weight without breaking <br><br>

      Versatile: Cassava bags can be made in different shapes and sizes, <br>
      and can be used for a variety of purposes
