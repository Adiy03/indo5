        <h2>Difference Between Red Ginger and Regular Ginger</h2>

        <p>
          The difference between red ginger and regular ginger lies in their physical characteristics, color, and taste. Here are some key differences between the two: <br><br>

          <b>Color:</b> Red ginger has a vibrant red color in its flower or bract, while regular ginger has a brown or golden color on its skin. This difference in color makes red ginger visually appealing and often used for decorative or ornamental purposes <br><br>

          <b>Taste:</b> Red ginger tends to have a spicier and stronger taste compared to regular ginger. The spiciness of red ginger is often more intense and provides a distinctive heat to food or beverages <br><br>

          Despite the differences in color, taste, and usage, both red ginger and regular ginger offer similar health benefits. They can help alleviate digestive disorders, have anti-inflammatory properties, and provide the characteristic spicy taste
