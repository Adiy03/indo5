        <strong>Curries and Stews:</strong> Mung beans can be added to vegetable curries and stews for added texture and nutrition. They absorb the flavors of the spices and vegetables they are cooked with <br><br>
        
        <strong>Fritters:</strong> Mung beans can be ground into a paste and used to make fritters or pancakes. In Indian cuisine, these are known as "moong dal pakoras" or "moong dal chillas." They are seasoned with spices and often include vegetables <br><br>
        
        <strong>Desserts:</strong> Mung beans are used to make sweet dishes and desserts in some Asian cuisines. Mung bean paste, made by cooking and mashing mung beans with sugar, is used as a filling in pastries, buns, and desserts like mooncakes <br><br>
