        <strong>Grilling:</strong> Grilling king mackerel is a popular way to prepare it. The firm flesh of the fish holds up well on the grill, and the high heat adds a smoky flavor to the meat. You can marinate it with herbs, spices, and oil before grilling for added flavor <br><br>
        
        <strong>Baking:</strong> King mackerel can be baked in the oven. You can prepare it with a variety of seasonings, including garlic, lemon, herbs, and spices. Baking allows you to cook the fish with minimal added fat, making it a healthier option <br><br>
        
        <strong>Broiling:</strong> Broiling is a quick method to cook king mackerel. Place seasoned fillets under the broiler for a few minutes until they are browned and cooked through <br><br>
        
        <strong>Pan-Frying:</strong> Pan-frying king mackerel in a hot skillet with a bit of oil creates a crispy exterior while keeping the inside moist and flavorful. You can coat the fillets with breadcrumbs or a light batter for added texture <br><br>
        
        <strong>Smoking:</strong> King mackerel can be smoked to create a rich, smoky flavor. Smoked king mackerel is often used in salads, spreads, and dips. It's a popular ingredient in smoked fish pâté <br><br>

        <strong>Fish Tacos:</strong> King mackerel can be grilled or pan-fried and used as a filling for fish tacos. Top it with fresh salsa, slaw, and your favorite toppings for a delicious meal <br><br>
        
        <strong>Fish Cakes:</strong> King mackerel can be flaked and used to make fish cakes or fish patties. Combine it with breadcrumbs, herbs, spices, and binding agents like eggs to form patties that are pan-fried until golden brown <br><br>
