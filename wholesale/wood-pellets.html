        <h2>Wood Pellets Uses :</h2><br>

        <strong>Residential Heating:</strong> Wood pellets are frequently used in residential pellet stoves and pellet boilers for space heating. These appliances are designed to burn pellets efficiently and provide a source of warmth for homes. They are known for their convenience and clean-burning characteristics <br><br>
        
        <strong>Commercial and Industrial Heating:</strong> Many commercial and industrial facilities use wood pellet boilers and furnaces for heating. These systems can provide heat for large spaces, such as warehouses, schools, and factories <br><br>
        
        <strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> Wood pellets can be burned in power plants to generate electricity. This is especially common in regions where biomass power generation is promoted as a renewable energy source <br><br>
        
        <strong>Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems:</strong> Some facilities use wood pellet CHP systems, which produce both electricity and heat simultaneously. These systems are highly efficient and are often used in district heating schemes <br><br>
        
        <strong>Hot Water Production:</strong> Wood pellet boilers can also be used to produce hot water for domestic use, such as for showers and faucets. This is common in residential and small-scale commercial applications <br><br>
        
        <strong>Pellet Grills:</strong> Wood pellet grills and smokers use wood pellets as a fuel source for outdoor cooking. They provide a distinctive smoky flavor to grilled foods and are known for their precise temperature control <br><br>
        
        <strong>Animal Bedding:</strong> Wood pellets can be used as bedding material for animals, such as horses, poultry, and small pets. They provide a comfortable and absorbent surface for animals while also being easy to clean <br><br>
        
        <strong>Cat Litter:</strong> Some cat litters are made from compressed wood pellets. They are absorbent and help control odors <br><br>
        
        <strong>Pelletized Horse Bedding:</strong> Wood pellets can also be specifically designed for use as horse bedding. They are highly absorbent and can reduce the amount of bedding material needed in horse stalls <br><br>
