          <h2>Mango uses:</h2> <br>

          <strong>Fresh Consumption:</strong> Eating ripe mangoes fresh is one of the most popular ways to enjoy them. Simply peel the skin and slice the flesh off the large seed. The sweet and juicy flesh can be eaten as-is or added to fruit salads <br><br>
          
          <strong>Smoothies:</strong> Mangoes add a natural sweetness and tropical flavor to smoothies. Blend mango chunks with yogurt, milk, or a dairy-free alternative, along with other fruits like bananas or berries for a refreshing beverage <br><br>
          
          <strong>Salsas:</strong> Mango salsa is a delicious accompaniment to grilled meats, seafood, or as a topping for tacos and nachos. It typically includes diced mango, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, and sometimes chili peppers for a sweet and spicy kick <br><br>
          
          <strong>Chutneys:</strong> Mango chutney is a popular condiment in many cuisines. It can be sweet or savory and pairs well with various dishes, including curries, grilled meats, and cheese platters <br><br>
          
          <strong>Desserts:</strong> Mangoes can be used in a variety of desserts, such as mango sorbet, mango ice cream, mango cheesecake, or mango pudding. The natural sweetness and vibrant color of mangoes make them a great addition to sweets <br><br>
          
          <strong>Fruit Salads:</strong> Add diced mango to fruit salads to enhance their flavor and add a tropical twist. Mango pairs well with other fruits like pineapple, strawberries, and kiwi <br><br>
                    
          <strong>Preserves and Jams:</strong> Mangoes can be used to make homemade preserves, jams, and spreads. Cooked with sugar and sometimes spices like ginger, these can be enjoyed on toast or as a condiment <br><br>
          
          <strong> Lassi:</strong> Mango lassi is a popular Indian drink made by blending mango with yogurt and a touch of sugar. It's creamy, sweet, and perfect for cooling down on a hot day <br><br>
          
          <strong>Curries:</strong> In some cuisines, particularly in Southeast Asia, green mangoes are used in savory dishes like mango curry. The tartness of green mangoes complements the spices and flavors of curries <br><br>
          
          <strong>Dried Mango:</strong> Mango slices can be dried to make a sweet and chewy snack. Dried mango is often available in stores and can be added to trail mixes or enjoyed on its own <br><br>
          
          <strong>Mango Chunks for Freezing:</strong> You can peel and chop ripe mangoes into chunks, then freeze them for later use in smoothies or desserts <br><br>
          
          <strong>Mango Juice:</strong> Mangoes can be juiced to make fresh mango juice or used as an ingredient in tropical juice blends <br><br>
