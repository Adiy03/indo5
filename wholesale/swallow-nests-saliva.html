        The nests of swiftlets, a type of swallow, are the main ingredient in bird's nest soup. The nests are carefully cleaned and processed to remove impurities. The cleaned nests are then soaked in water to soften them, and any remaining debris is removed <br><br>

        <h3>Cosmetics and Skincare:</h3><br> 
        Some cosmetic and skincare products incorporate swallow nest extracts or components due to the belief that they contain beneficial compounds for the skin. These products may include creams, lotions, and masks that claim to have rejuvenating and moisturizing properties <br><br>

        <h3>Traditional Medicine:</h3> <br>

        <h3>Supplements and Tonics:</h3> <br> 
        Some dietary supplements and tonics incorporate swallow nest extracts or powdered forms of the nests. These products are often marketed as natural health enhancers <br><br>

        <h3>Gifts and Souvenirs:</h3> <br>
