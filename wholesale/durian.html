          Durian is a tropical fruit known for its distinctive odor, which is often described as strong and pungent. It is sometimes called the "king of fruits" in Southeast Asia, where it is particularly popular <br><br>
          
          The flavor of durian is quite unique. The texture of the flesh is often compared to custard or creamy pudding, and it can be quite rich and smooth <br><br>

          <h2>Durian Uses:</h2><br>

          Durian is a versatile fruit used in various culinary applications across Southeast Asia. Here are some common uses of durian: <br><br>

          <strong>Consuming Fresh:</strong> The most traditional way to enjoy durian is by eating it fresh. The creamy, custard-like flesh is scooped out and eaten directly. Some people like to sprinkle sugar on it to enhance its sweetness <br><br>
          
          <strong>Desserts:</strong> Durian is a popular ingredient in desserts, adding a unique flavor and creamy texture. It is used to make durian ice cream, durian sticky rice, durian custard, and durian pancakes, among other treats <br><br>
          
          <strong>Smoothies and Shakes:</strong> Durian is often blended into smoothies and shakes, either on its own or with other fruits and ingredients. It can be combined with milk, yogurt, or ice to create a refreshing beverage <br><br>
          
          <strong>Pastries and Baked Goods:</strong> Durian is used to fill pastries, cakes, and bread. Durian-filled buns and durian puffs are common examples of these baked goods <br><br>
          
          <strong>Candies and Snacks:</strong> Durian-flavored candies, chips, and snacks are available in some regions. These products often capture the essence of durian without the strong odor <br><br>
          
          <strong>Curries and Savory Dishes:</strong> While durian is more commonly associated with sweet dishes, it is occasionally used in savory recipes as well. In some Thai and Indonesian dishes, durian can be added to curries and stews for a unique flavor <br><br>
          
          <strong>Durian Jam:</strong> Durian jam or spread is made by cooking durian pulp with sugar until it reaches a jam-like consistency. It can be spread on toast or used as a filling in pastries <br><br>
          
          <strong>Durian Sauces:</strong> Durian can be processed into sauces or purees to be used as a flavoring for various dishes, both sweet and savory <br><br>
          
          <strong>Durian Beverages:</strong> Durian can be used to make beverages like durian milkshakes, durian smoothie bowls, and durian-flavored drinks <br><br>
          
          <strong>Durian Coffee:</strong> Durian coffee blends use durian extract or flavoring to create a unique coffee experience with a hint of durian flavor <br><br>
          
          <strong>Durian-flavored Products:</strong> Beyond food items, durian flavoring is used in various products, including candies, chocolates, and even durian-flavored chewing gum <br><br>
