        Merbau (Intsia bijuga) is a tropical hardwood species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Indonesia <br><br> 
        
        Merbau wood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown to dark brown color, attractive grain patterns, and natural oils that contribute to its durability <br><br>

        <strong>Decking:</strong> Merbau hardwood decking is commonly used for outdoor spaces such as patios, balconies, and decks <br><br>
        
        Its natural resistance to decay, insect attack, and harsh weather conditions makes it an excellent choice for exterior applications. Merbau decking can withstand heavy foot traffic and requires minimal maintenance, making it a preferred option for both residential and commercial projects <br><br>

        <strong>Flooring:</strong> Merbau hardwood flooring is sought after for its warmth, elegance, and longevity. It is a suitable option for indoor flooring in various settings, including homes, offices, and public spaces. The wood's dense nature and natural oils enhance its resistance to wear and tear, making it ideal for high-traffic areas <br><br>
