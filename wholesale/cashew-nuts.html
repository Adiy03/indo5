        <strong>Snacking: </strong>Cashews can be eaten as a satisfying and nutritious snack on their own. Roasted and salted cashews are a popular choice, but you can also enjoy them unsalted or flavored with various seasonings <br><br>
        
        <strong>Cashew Butter:</strong> Cashew butter is a creamy and delicious alternative to peanut butter or almond butter. It can be spread on toast, used as a dip for fruits and vegetables, or incorporated into recipes for sauces and dressings <br><br>
        
        <strong>Smoothies:</strong> Cashews can be blended into smoothies to add creaminess and a nutty flavor. They also contribute healthy fats and protein to your morning or post-workout shake <br><br>
        
        <strong>Desserts:</strong> Cashews are commonly used in vegan and dairy-free desserts to create creamy textures. You can make cashew-based cheesecakes, ice creams, puddings, and truffles. Cashews can also be used to make dairy-free whipped cream <br><br>
        
        <strong>Curries and Sauces:</strong> Cashew nuts can be ground into a paste and used to thicken and add richness to curries, soups, and sauces. In Indian cuisine, cashew paste is often used in dishes like korma <br><br>
        
        <strong>Stir-Fries:</strong> Tossing cashews into stir-fried dishes, along with vegetables and protein sources like tofu or chicken, can add crunch and flavor to your meals <br><br>
        
        <strong>Salads:</strong> Sprinkle toasted cashews on top of salads for added texture and a delightful nutty taste. Cashews pair well with greens, fruits, and various dressings <br><br>
